                <h2>About Signable</h2>
                <p>Signable is a cutting-edge online flashcard application developed by a dedicated team at Princeton University. Led by Ethan Puckett, the team includes Marvin Chen, Vishva Illavelan, and Roger Weng. Our mission is to enhance the learning experience for ASL students by providing a specialized platform that goes beyond traditional study tools.</p>

                <h3>Features and Goals</h3>
                <p>Signable focuses on delivering a unique visual learning experience for ASL users. Our MVP includes a robust flashcard feature, allowing students to practice ASL to English and vice versa. Users can shuffle and star flashcards, and administrators have the ability to manage and customize flashcard sets for different classes.</p>

                <p>With an intuitive interface, Signable supports self-study, providing example sentences, memory tools, and a comparison interface for users to evaluate their signing skills. We aim to digitize and streamline ASL learning at Princeton, making it more accessible and enjoyable.</p>
